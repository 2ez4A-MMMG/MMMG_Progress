Hello,

and welcome to our weekly Cars News.
Today, an explosion happened in Route XY,
where the source was believed to be from a car crashing onto a gas station.
That explosion resulted to 26 deaths, and collapse of a nearby company building as well.
A corpse of that company's president was found among the corpses in the car of today's topic,
who was witnessed having an argument with the car's owner while the car was driven in a rather unstable manner.
First-hand investigation revealed that the company was undergoing bankruptcy due to investment scams,
and thus the investigation team decided not to rule it out as a simple accident yet.
