*Customer1*: This place can be crowded at times, eh?
*Customer1*: Beware not to bump into any <color=*highlightColor*>roadblocks</color>, lad.
*Customer1*: I don't want to spend more time on traffic than I already do.

[title=Customer1_Talk3_START]
*Customer1*: It is really often to see you young lads doing this cab driving thing. How much does it earn you?
*Customer1*: If you have time, you should learn some stock investments. That could help you earn your extra keep, you know.
[title=Customer1_Talk3_END]

[title=Customer1_Talk4_START]
*Customer1*: Hey, young lad, you listening?
*Customer1*: Apparently the stock of a company I invested in rose up in great numbers.
*Customer1*: How much, you ask? It's higher than you could imagine, lad. Hahahaha.
*Customer1*: Here, take these. I am in good mood today for some extra tips to lads like you.
[title=Customer1_Talk4_END]

[title=Customer1_Talk5_START]
*Customer1*: (sigh)
*Customer1*: Lad, remember the last time I said about a company's stock I invested in?
*Customer1*: Turns out it's nothing more than a scam......
*Customer1*: ......and now all that money......all in for just a damn third-rate prank......

[title=Customer2_Talk2_START]
*Customer2*: I hope I won't be late for today's class too......
*Customer2*: You don't mind if we go a little faster?
*Customer2*: There should be a <color=*highlightColor*>shortcut</color> or something that we could use.
[title=Customer2_Talk2_END]

[title=Customer2_Talk3_START]
*Customer2*: Now that I think of it, having a cab-driving job is probably not too bad of an idea.
*Customer2*: I mean, if you're lucky, you could even hit on pretty girls like me, right?
[title=Customer2_Talk3_END]

[title=Customer2_Talk4_START]
*Customer2*: Thank you for the ride, handsome.
*Customer2*: If you don't mind, here's some tips for you.
*Customer2*: Let's say it's a bonus for driving a pretty customer like me.
[title=Customer2_Talk4_END]

[title=Customer2_Talk5_START]
*Customer2*: Hi there, handsome.
*Customer2*: So, about the money you took last time......you saw the message in it too, right?

[title=Customer3_Talk2_END]

[title=Customer3_Talk3_START]

[title=Customer4_Talk1_END]

[title=Customer4_Talk2_START]
*Customer4*: Ah, I probably did the correct thing by calling the cabs. The route seems confusing......
*Customer4*: It looks like <color=*highlightColor*>random things</color> would happen at times in some roads. 
*Customer4*: Hopefully it's shortcuts instead of roadblocks and such......
[title=Customer4_Talk2_END]

[title=Customer4_Talk3_START]
